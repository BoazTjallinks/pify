# Pify
An easy to use control panel for your Raspberry PI or any other device that runs Linux*

# Setup
You'll have to make a `.env` file with the following format:
```
PASSWORD="Your Password Here"
```

*= I'm not going to guarantee that the tool is gonna run on another device as it's coded for the Raspberry PI 3B+ and soon Pi 4B
